    This API is meant for provisioning resources in a target Cloud Environment in a vendor-agnostic fashion. By
    implementing this API, vendors make it possible to automatically provision accounts via ATAT.

    ## Portfolios

    Portfolios represent a logical container for a group of related Environments and the Task Orders/CLINs which fund
    them. As a general rule, everything within a given Portfolio is part of the same overall Mission or Program.

    ## Environments

    Environments represent a logical container for a set of cloud resources which are funded by a particular CLIN within
    a Task Order. The term is meant to be agnostic across CSPs. An Environment can be thought of as an account at the
    root of a hierarchy. ATAT does not dictate structure within a Portfolio. Once an Environment has been provisioned a
    Mission Owner is free to organize and secure resources to satisfy mission requirements.

    ## Task Orders

    Portfolios contain one or more *Task Orders* (TO), which in turn contain or more or *Contract Line Item Number*
    (CLINs). Each have separate Periods of Performance (PoP) dates; CLIN PoP dates will be within the time frames of
    the Task Order in which they belong.

    ## Cost reporting

    Provisioned resources incur costs with participating CSPs. Costs related to provisioned resources can
    be attributed to specific CLINs. Actual and forecasted CSP costs can be reported by CLIN.

      description: >-
        Represents an OIDC configuration for an Identity Provider which will be managed by the ATAT client. ATAT
        implementations should be configured to accept and validate tokens issued by it. Tokens will not contain
        information or assertions about end-user identity and should purely be used as a means for authentication
        of the ATAT client implementation and for authorization of that client's actions. ATAT servers must not
        assume that any user identities specified in request bodies (such as Mission Owners or administrators)
        can be authenticated using this identity provider and must only use this Identity Provider for the ATAT
        CSP API.

        ATAT implementations must leverage the OIDC discovery protocol using the provided URL and must handle
        key rotation automatically.

        ## Validation

        Tokens may include an Audience and if present, ATAT servers must reject any token with an incorrect Audience;
        however, ATAT servers must accept tokens without an Audience if otherwise valid. ATAT implementations must
        not limit access to specific subjects and must accept a request from a client presenting valid, unexpired,
        properly-scoped token. ATAT servers must ignore unrecognized attributes.

        ## Discovery Configuration

        The openIdConnectUrl below is meant for integration testing purposes only. It is expected to remain stable
        but may change occasionally. When this occurs, the ATAT Team will coordinate with the community and update this
