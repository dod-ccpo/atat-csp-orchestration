    This API is meant for provisioning resources in a target Cloud Environment in a vendor-agnostic fashion. By
    implementing this API, vendors make it possible to automatically provision accounts via ATAT.

    ## Portfolios

    Portfolios represent a logical container for a set of cloud resources which are paid for by a Task Order and its
    CLIN(s). The term is meant to be agnostic across CSPs. A Portfolio can be thought of as an account at the root of a 
    hierarchy. ATAT does not dictate structure within a Portfolio. Once a Portfolio has been provisioned a Mission Owner 
    is free to organize and secure resources to satisfy mission requirements.

    ## Task Orders

    Portfolios contain one or more *Task Orders* (TO), which in turn contain or more or *Contract Line Item Number*
    (CLINs). Each have separate Periods of Performance (PoP) dates; CLIN PoP dates will be within the time frames of
    the Task Order in which they belong.

    ## Cost reporting

    Provisioned resources incur costs with participating CSPs. Costs related to provisioned resources can
    be attributed to specific CLINs. Actual and forecasted CSP costs can be reported by CLIN.

        Adds a new Portfolio to be provisioned, including Task Orders and Operators. Once provisioned, Operators can
        log in to the CSP and begin using provisioned resources and services, funded by the provided Task Order(s).
        Note that invitations should be sent to all Operator email addresses included in the request. See
        [#/info/description](#/info/description) and [#/components/schemas](#/components/schemas) for details of
        these constructs.

        Updates an existing Portfolio. Currently limited to the `administrators` attribute which will add
        administrators to an existing Portfolio. Note that this is a strictly additive operation; invitations
        should be sent to all email addresses included in a request. It is expected that removal of access
        will occur through native CSP mechanisms rather than via ATAT.

        When an Operator included in this operation does not already have access to the Portfolio in the target
        Cloud Environment and an invitation should be sent to that Operator's email address. ATAT clients should
        not specify the `needs_reset` flag for Operators that do not already have access; however, ATAT
        implementations must ignore the flag for such Operators who do not already have access.

        When an Operator included in this operator already has access to the Portfolio in the target Cloud
        Environment and the `needs_reset` attribute is set to `true`, their access should be reset (whether
        via a token, password, or other vendor-specific means). When an Operator already has access to the
        Portfolio in the target Cloud Environment and the `needs_reset` attribute is unspecified or `false`,
        ATAT implementations must not make changes to the user's access nor perform any resets.

      description: >-
        Represents an OIDC configuration for an Identity Provider which will be managed by the ATAT client. ATAT
        implementations should be configured to accept and validate tokens issued by it. Tokens will not contain
        information or assertions about end-user identity and should purely be used as a means for authentication
        of the ATAT client implementation and for authorization of that client's actions. ATAT servers must not
        assume that any user identities specified in request bodies (such as Mission Owners or administrators)
        can be authenticated using this identity provider and must only use this Identity Provider for the ATAT
        CSP API.

        ATAT implementations must leverage the OIDC discovery protocol using the provided URL and must handle
        key rotation automatically.

        ## Validation

        Tokens may include an Audience and if present, ATAT servers must reject any token with an incorrect Audience;
        however, ATAT servers must accept tokens without an Audience if otherwise valid. ATAT implementations must
        not limit access to specific subjects and must accept a request from a client presenting valid, unexpired,
        properly-scoped token. ATAT servers must ignore unrecognized attributes.

        The openIdConnectUrl below is meant for integration testing purposes only. It is expected to remain stable
        but may change occasionally. When this occurs, the ATAT Team will coordinate with the community and update this
