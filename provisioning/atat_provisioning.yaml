    This API is meant for provisioning resources in a JWCC Provider Cloud Environment.
    The cloud products and services used in JWCC are provided by commercial cloud service providers (CSP).
    This API will be implemented and maintained by all participating CSPs.

    ## Organization of provisioned resources
    
    Provisioned resources under the purview of a mission owner are organized in a three-level hierarchy.
    *Portfolios* consist of one or more applications. *Applications* consist of one or more environments.
    *Environments* directly contain provisioned resources.

    * Portfolio
      * Application
        * Environment

    ## Access and security

    Although the implementation of these concepts will vary by vendor, adherence to the following principles is expected:
     - Each Portfolio, Application, and Environment will have isolated security controls
     - Access can be granted to *Operators* at each level
     - Administrative access to a Portfolio will provide inherited access to all contained Applications
     - Administrative access to an Application will provide inherited access to all contained Environments
     - Actual CSP resources and services (any IaaS or PaaS offerings from the CSP) will be provisioned only within an Environment

    Operators are specified generically as email/access level tuples. See [#/components/schemas/PortfolioOperatorRole](#/components/schemas/PortfolioOperatorRole) for an example.
    ATAT will request that individuals (uniquely identified by email address) be granted access to specific resources (Portfolios, Applications or Environments).
    It is expected that CSPs will manage account lifecycle and authorize Operators according to these requests.

    ### Access levels

    While the details of ATAT's generic access levels will differ by CSP, the following general guidelines apply:
    
    #### Portfolio Access Levels
     - `portfolio_administrator`: Root-level "break-glass" administrator account for all resources and operators under this Portfolio.
    
    #### Application and Environment Access Levels
     - `administrator`: Has full access to all assets under this Application/Environment.
     - `contributor`: Has access to create, update or remove resources under this Application/Environment. Cannot manage operator access.
     - `read_only`: Has access to view resources, configurations or logs under this Application/Environment, but cannot make any changes or create new resources.

    ## Funding sources

    Portfolios contain one or more *Funding Sources*. A funding source consists of a
    *Task Order* (TO) and a *Contract Line Item Number* (CLIN) on that TO. TOs contain one or more CLINs.
    CLINs specify funding amounts and a time period in which funds can be spent.

    ## Cost reporting

    Provisioned resources incur costs with participating CSPs. Costs related to provisioned resources can
    be attributed to specific CLINs. Actual and forecasted CSP costs can be reported by CLIN.

      description: Adds a new Portfolio to be provisioned, including Applications, Environments, and Operators. Once provisioned, Operators can log in to the CSP and begin using provisioned resources and services, funded by the provided Funding Source(s). See [#/info/description](#/info/description) and [#/components/schemas](#/components/schemas) for details of these constructs.
